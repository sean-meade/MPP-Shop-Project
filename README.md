# MPP-Project Project to Build Shop

In each language run the file named shop.

Java files are a bit of a mess I was hoping to clean them up. I couldn't get the file to update properly in Java the rest should work fine.

I didn't leave myself anough time to write a full report so here is what I learned:

1. Just because a language can used in OOP doesn't mean it will be handy to make in a short amount of time. Java was my OOP language part of this project and I still don't understand it fully.

2. C requires a lot of planning. Unlike Python you actually have to sit down and write out how the logic of the programme will go. In hindsight I probably could have kept it much more simple. This ease of Python vs. a lower-level language like C is evident in the sheer length of code it takes to do the same thing (like ignoring case sensitivity).

3. Memory allocation is wizardry that I think you can only understand by using a language like C. I understand it more then I did but still at times I’d be pulling my hair out if I had any left.

I thoroughly enjoyed this project and I’m sorry I couldn’t do it more justice. Thanks for a great semester and happy new year.
